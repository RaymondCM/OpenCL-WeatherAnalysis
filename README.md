# OpenCL-WeatherAnalysis

Implementation of Int/Float vector analysis in OpenCL. Data provided is weather data and a templated class is provided that 
demonstrates many basic and advanced parallel programming techniques and patterns. The interface to low level OpenCL algorithms is simple providing a greater abstraction from it.
